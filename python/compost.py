# Compost feedstock test - to determine if your compost recipe has an adequate C:N ratio

#in this case, the compost recipe only has 2 ingredients

#For the following, use raw_input to get the values and print relevant text beforehand to ask for input:
#Prompt the user to input the %C ingredient 1
#Prompt the user to input the %N ingredient 1
#Prompt the user to input the weight of ingredient 1 (W1)

#Prompt the user to input the %C ingredient 2 (C2, use raw_input)
#Prompt the user to input the %N ingredient 2 (N2, use raw_input)
#Prompt the user to input the weight of ingredient 2 (W2)

#Calculate C:N ratio given weight and % for each ingredient
    # multiply %C for ingredient 1 (C1) by weight (W1) to get carbon content (C1content)
    # multiply %C for ingredient 2 (C2) by weight (W2) to get carbon content (C2content)
    # multiply %N for ingredient 1 (N1) by weight (W1) to get nitrogen content (N1content)
    # multiply %N for ingredient 2 (N2) by weight (W2) to get nitrogen content (N2content)
    # Add C1content and C2content to get total C
    # Add N1 content and N2 content to get total N
    # Divide total_C by total_N
    # save that final C:N value


#If C:N < 20, print ("Your C:N ratio is too low. You need to add more C-rich material")

#elif C:N > 30, print ("Your C:N ratio is too high. You need to add more N-rich material"

#else (meaning it's between 20 and 30), print ("Your C:N ratio is OK!")
