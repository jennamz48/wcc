    <p> Rachel Carson, a renowned naturalist and writer, is most famous for her book <em> Silent Spring </em>, which increase raise public awareness around the negative consequences - to ecosystems and to human health - of chemical pesticides such as DDT. Before writing Silent Spring, Carson studied marine biology; she studied at Woods Hole Laboratory and pursued a master's degree in Zoology at John Hopkins University before landing a position as a biologist with the Bureau of Fisheries (now the <a href = "https://www.fws.gov/" target=_blank> U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a>), where she wrote a radio series about their marine research. A talented science writer, she wrote several books for the general public about the ocean, including <em> The Sea Around Us </em>, <em> Under the Sea Wind </em>, and <em> The Edge of the Sea </em>, before writing <em> Silent Spring </em>. Carson and her book <em> Silent Spring </em> were a catalyst in forming the modern environmentalist movement.
