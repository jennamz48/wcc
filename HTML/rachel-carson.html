    <p> Rachel Carson was a ecologist and writer most famous for her book <em> Silent Spring </em>, which helped raise public awareness about the negative consequences - to ecosystems and human health - of chemical pesticide application. Before writing Silent Spring, Carson studied marine biology; she studied at Woods Hole Laboratory and pursued a master's degree in Zoology at John Hopkins University before landing a position as a biologist with the Bureau of Fisheries (now the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service), where she wrote a radio series about their research. A talented science writer, she wrote several books for the general public before <em> Silent Spring </em> about the ocean, including <em> The Sea Around Us </em>, <em> Under the Sea Wind </em>, and <em> The Edge of the Sea </em>. Carson and her book <em> Silent Spring </em> were a catalyst in forming the modern environmentalist movement.
